# OpenSteamworks
OpenSteamworks is a C# library to interact with the currently running Steam Client. 
If you want to implement your own Steam Client, you should use OpenSteamworks.Client, although it is technically possible to make your own client with only OpenSteamworks as well. 
The best documentation for OpenSteamworks is looking at how OpenSteamworks.Client works.
